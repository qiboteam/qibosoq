# Qibosoq paper runcards

In this folder, we have stored the runcards used for the experiments presented in the Qibosoq paper.

For the timing experiments, we used the following runcards:
- `routines_benchmarks.yml`
- `scaling_benchmarks.yml`

These experiments were conducted on a platform analogous to the one described in `my_platform.yml`.

On the other hand, the calibration experiments were performed with the platform in `experiments_platform_runcard.yml`, but are exactly reproducible only with the same hardware.

These runcards are compatible and were executed with the following software versions:

| Software  | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Qibosoq   | 0.0.4   |
| Qibolab   | 0.1.0   |
| Qibocal   | 0.0.3   |
